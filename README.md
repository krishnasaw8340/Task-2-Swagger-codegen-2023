# Task 2. Swagger codegen.

Create the same REST API as in task #1, but use https://editor.swagger.io/ to create your API
definition and generate the server code. Choose any java-based server or server framework,
that you like. You can either use the online editor or generate the code manually, e.g. using this
document: https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/wiki/server-stub-generator-howto.
Make sure that you can deploy/run the generated code. Once your stub is ready - implement the
same functionality as described in task #1, but now in java.
Finally, be sure that you can show how your application responds to requests using postman,
curl or any other HTTP client.
